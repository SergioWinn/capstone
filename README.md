# 🧠 Bank Marketing Campaign Classification using AI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the effectiveness of a direct marketing campaign from a Portuguese bank, with the goal of predicting whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit. We also explore how AI language models (IBM Granite via Replicate) can support data analysis and business insight generation.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Bank Marketing Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruthgn/bank-marketing-data-set)
- Local file used: `dataset/bank-direct-marketing-campaigns.csv`

## ⚙️ Methods
- Data preprocessing & feature engineering
- Classification using Random Forest
- AI-supported insight generation using IBM Granite (LLM)

## 💡 Insight & Findings
- Most influential features include: `duration`, `contact`, `pdays`, `month`, and `previous`.
- The model achieved ~**X% accuracy** in predicting client subscription.
- LLM was able to summarize performance and suggest marketing strategies based on model results.

## 🤖 AI Support
We used IBM Granite via Replicate and LangChain to:
- Analyze model results
- Generate natural language insight
- Suggest marketing recommendations automatically
